Getting Things Done (GTD) is actually two things: A productivity method, and a best-selling book by author and productivity consultant David Allen. 
<p>It is a framework for organizing and tracking tasks, such that you can 100% trust that the things on your to do list truly are the things you need to do.
<p><h1>The built-in Calendar </h1>
<a href="wypyplus.py%3Fp=WyPyPlus.html">WyPyPlus</a> comes with a built-in calendar: <a href="wypyplus.py%3Fp=Calendar2021.html">Calendar2021</a>. You can create pages for important dates or put date or month in other documents as tags. 
<p><h1>Create Pages and Tags</h1>
<p>Click the ? marks at the end of each word to create them.
<p>InBox
<p>NextAction
<p>WaitingFor
<p>MyProjects
<p>MyReferences
<p>SomeDay
<p>TrashBin
<p>You can create tag pages and add them anywhere in other wiki pages. Later, you can find all the references by using the reverse index.
<p>Here are a few example tags:
AtHome, AtOffice, HaveDone, ToDay, ThisWeek, ThisMonth, May04
<p><h1>Add a Shortcut Menu.</h1>
<p>Jumping between pages could be a hassle. For easy access, you can put a group of links in a file and include it in other files. 
<p>Create a GtdMenu page and copy the following links:<pre><code>
InBox | NextAction | MyProject | WaitingFor | [Today]{wypyplus.py?p=Today} </code></pre>
Now you can put @INCLUDE=GtdMenu on other pages. Note that <b>Today</b> is special page name maps to the wiki page of the day.  
<p><h1>Add a Template Page</h1>
<p>
You can use template to put pre-defined text to new wiki pages. A template starts with "Tpl" and follows by three characters. It will match a page if the page starts with the same three characters. For example, if you create a page called TplJul with the following content:
<p><li> My Priority</li>
<li> My Accomplishments</li>
<p>When you create a new page Jul04, <a href="wypyplus.py%3Fp=WyPyPlus.html">WyPyPlus</a> will use the template.
<p><h1>Workflow</h1>
<p>The GTD workflow consists of five stages: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. 
<p><li> Capture: Collect what has your attention. ...</li>
<li> Clarify: Process what it means. ...</li>
<li> Organize: Put it where it belongs. ...</li>
<li> Reflect: Review frequently. ...</li>
<li> Engage: Simply do.</li>
