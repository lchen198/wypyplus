This is a simple template for setting up GetThingsDone (GTD) in WyPyPlus.


# What is GTD
Getting Things Done (GTD) is actually two things: A productivity method, and a best-selling book by author and productivity consultant David Allen. 

It is a framework for organizing and tracking tasks, such that you can 100% trust that the things on your to do list truly are the things you need to do.

# The built-in Calendar 
WyPyPlus comes with a built-in calendar: Calendar2021. You can create pages for important dates or put date or month in other documents as tags. 

# Create Pages and Tags

Click the ? marks at the end of each word to create page.

InBox

NextAction

WaitingFor

MyProjects

MyReferences

SomeDay

TrashBin

Similarly, you can create tag pages and add them anywhere in other wiki pages. Later, you can find all the references by using the reverse index.

Here are a few example tags:
AtHome, AtOffice, HaveDone, ToDay, ThisWeek, ThisMonth, May04

# Add a Shortcut Menu.
Jumping between pages could be a hassle. For easy access, you can put a group of links on the top of the pages that you often use.

Here's an example:
GetThingsDone | InBox | NextAction | WaitingFor

# Workflow

The GTD workflow consists of five stages: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. 

* Capture: Collect what has your attention. ...
* Clarify: Process what it means. ...
* Organize: Put it where it belongs. ...
* Reflect: Review frequently. ...
* Engage: Simply do.

Once all the material is captured in the InBox, each item is clarified and organized by asking and answering questions about each item in turn as shown in the black boxes in the logic tree diagram. 

Take action on each item in the InBox. 
* in the TrashBin if not needed.
* on the SomeDay list.
* in MyReference.
* add tasks to MyProject if it takes more than two minutes. 
* delegated to someone else and, if one wants a reminder to follow up, added to a WaitingFor list.
* on NextAction list if there is only one step to complete it.
* on the Calendar2021.
* Empty one's InBox daily or at least weekly. Don't use one's inbox as a "to do" list. Don't put clarified items back into the inbox. Emptying one's inbox doesn't mean finishing everything. It just means applying the "capture, clarify, organize" steps to all one's "stuff".

Next, reflection (termed planning in the first edition) occurs. Multi-step projects identified above are assigned a desired outcome and a single NextAction". Finally, a task from one's task list is worked on unless the calendar dictates otherwise. One selects which task to work on next by considering where one is (i.e., the "context", such as at home, at work, out shopping, by the phone, at one's computer, with a particular person), time available, energy available, and priority.
