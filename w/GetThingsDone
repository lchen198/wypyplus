# What is GTD
Getting Things Done (GTD) is actually two things: A productivity method, and a best-selling book by author and productivity consultant David Allen. 

It is a framework for organizing and tracking tasks, such that you can 100% trust that the things on your to do list truly are the things you need to do.

# The built-in Calendar 
WyPyPlus comes with a built-in calendar: Calendar2021. You can create pages for important dates or put date or month in other documents as tags. 

# Create Pages and Tags

Click the ? marks at the end of each word to create them.

InBox

NextAction

WaitingFor

MyProjects

MyReferences

SomeDay

TrashBin

You can create tag pages and add them anywhere in other wiki pages. Later, you can find all the references by using the reverse index.

Here are a few example tags:
AtHome, AtOffice, HaveDone, ToDay, ThisWeek, ThisMonth, May04

# Add a Shortcut Menu.

Jumping between pages could be a hassle. For easy access, you can put a group of links in a file and include it in other files. 

Create a GtdMenu page and copy the following links:
```
InBox | NextAction | MyProject | WaitingFor | [Today]{wypyplus.py?p=Today} 
```
Now you can put @INCLUDE=GtdMenu on other pages. Note that **Today** is special page name maps to the wiki page of the day.  

# Add a Template Page


You can use template to put pre-defined text to new wiki pages. A template starts with "Tpl" and follows by three characters. It will match a page if the page starts with the same three characters. For example, if you create a page called TplJul with the following content:

* My Priority
* My Accomplishments

When you create a new page Jul04, WyPyPlus will use the template.

# Workflow

The GTD workflow consists of five stages: capture, clarify, organize, reflect, and engage. 

* Capture: Collect what has your attention. ...
* Clarify: Process what it means. ...
* Organize: Put it where it belongs. ...
* Reflect: Review frequently. ...
* Engage: Simply do.
