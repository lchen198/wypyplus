WyPyPlus (pronounced "whippy plus") is a minimalist wiki server in 23 lines of code. It is an extension of [wypy wiki](http://infomesh.net/2003/wypy/) written by Sean B. Palmer. The original project implements a wiki in just 11 lines of Python code, which is an amazing achievement. However, wypy wiki doesn't have many features I consider as essential.

### You will be amazed by how much you can do with a simple tool

* Only 23 lines of Python code.
* Run on Mac, Linux and Windows.
* Support the basic wiki syntax. [DemoPage](https://github.com/lchen198/wypyplus/blob/main/w/DemoPage)
* Save plain text files under the /w folder.

### To make your life easier
* An example calendar and daily journal.
* An example GetThingsDone guide to help you set up GTD quickly.
* A template system to insert pre-defined content.
* Full-text search.
* A modernized and mobile-friendly look using [Sakura CSS](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura).
* Delete a wiki page from disk by saving an empty content.
* Each WikiPage has a reverse index. You can use this feature to group pages by tags.
* An [index page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/wypyplus.py?p=All&q=f) to show all your files in sorted order.
* AutoSave after 30 minutes of editing.
* Use @INCLUDE=WikiPage to include content from another page. 
* (Optional) Syntax highlight with [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org).
* (Optional) Display [Ascii Math](http://asciimath.org) or LaTaX notations.
* (Optional) Read-only mode


## Text Formatting
* WikiNames are replaced with internal links.
* Markdown style ****bold****.
* "\n{{" starts an unordered list.
* "\n* [text]" is a list item in an unordered list.
* "\n}}" ends an unordered list.
* "\n#" inserts H1.
* "\n##" inserts H2.
* "\n###" inserts H3.
* To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple back-ticks.
* "---" creates an <hr> element.
* Markdown style [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links) and [image tag](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1)
* Use @INCLUDE=WikiPage at the begging of the line to include another file.
* All HTML is replaced with its quoted equivalent (i.e. is forbidden).

## Install and Use

* You need Python 2 to run this application. Mac and Linux already have Python 2. For Windows users, please install Python 2.7.

* Download WyPyPlus and extract it to a folder (E.g wypy_wiki).
```
cd wypy_wiki

python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000 

python3 -m http.server --cgi 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1

Open this url in your browser. It takes a few moments to start.
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/wypyplus.py
```

### How to use the read-only mode

The edit variable holds the icon of the edit button. You can change it
to whatever you like. If you set it to an empty string, WyPyPlus will
not show the edit button and disable the edit request handler.
```
edit='âœŽ'
```

### How to create tags
There's no difference between Tags and WikiWords. When you create a new page, there will be a link on the top of the screen to show all pages that reference it. 

For example, you can create a page called ToDo, and put the word ToDo to other pages and see references here:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/cgi-bin/wypyplus?p=ToDo&q=f

### How to define and use a template
You can create a template just like any other wiki page. A template name must start with "Tpl" and follow by three characters. WyPyPlus will automatically insert its content to a new wiki page when the first three characters of the page matches the template

For example, If you create a template page called TplJan, a new page called Jan23 will load the content from the template.
