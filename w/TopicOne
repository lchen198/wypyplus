You can easily turn WyPyPlus Wiki into a presentation tool with the following steps:


* Add more pages and content. You can put links on the top of every page for easy navigation.
* Modify the **home** variable in wypyplys.py to set a title for your presentation.
* Turn on read-only mode by setting the **edit** variable to empty. It will hide the edit button and the search bar.
